What is the best way for website automation which is written in Angular 17-18 and single-spa. Including page redirection outside current domain

ChatGPT said:
For automating a website built with Angular 17–18 and Single-SPA (micro-frontend architecture) — especially when you need cross-domain redirection handling — the best automation solution typically depends on your goals (e.g. testing, scraping, monitoring). Here's a clear breakdown of the best tools and strategies for end-to-end automation of such a site.

✅ Recommended Approach: Use Playwright
📌 Why Playwright?
Playwright is highly reliable for modern SPAs and micro-frontends due to its support for:

Cross-domain navigation

Shadow DOM, if used

Angular, React, Vue, and other modern frameworks

Auto-waiting (resolves race conditions)

Parallel test execution and context isolation

🔧 1. Setup Playwright
bash
Copy
Edit
npm init playwright@latest
# Or for just Angular:
npm install -D @playwright/test
Example Playwright Test (cross-domain + Angular SPA):
ts
Copy
Edit
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('navigate and verify across domains and micro-frontends', async ({ page }) => {
  // Start at your Angular micro-frontend
  await page.goto('https://app.domain-a.com');

  // Wait for an Angular element
  await page.getByText('Dashboard').click();

  // Redirect to another domain
  await page.goto('https://service.domain-b.com');

  // Interact with another micro-frontend or login flow
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();

  // Validate redirection back to app
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard/);
});
🧠 2. Handling Angular Internals
Playwright doesn’t need to hook into Angular internals like Protractor (deprecated), but you can wait for Angular stability with:

ts
Copy
Edit
await page.waitForFunction(() => {
  return (window as any).getAllAngularTestabilities?.()
    .every((testability: any) => testability.isStable());
});
🌍 3. Cross-domain Context Isolation
When navigating to another domain (e.g. SSO, external login):

ts
Copy
Edit
const context = await browser.newContext();
const newPage = await context.newPage();
await newPage.goto('https://external-domain.com');
// Do external auth or redirection
await newPage.close();
🧪 4. Alternatives (Less Recommended)
Cypress
✅ Good Angular support

❌ Poor native cross-domain support (requires workarounds)

Selenium + WebDriver
✅ Very flexible

❌ Slower, more fragile in SPAs, less developer-friendly

Puppeteer
✅ Lightweight, Chrome-only

❌ Less robust and cross-browser than Playwright

✅ Summary: Best Practice Stack
Goal	Tool/Strategy
End-to-end testing (SPA + cross-domain)	Playwright
Micro-frontend automation	Use page.frame() or page.locator() targeting per micro-frontend
Cross-domain handling	Use browser.newContext() or page.goto() with cookies/auth
CI Integration	GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI
