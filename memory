If your Node.js project is calling a Spring API using Axios and memory is not being freed after the handler completes — especially in failure cases — the issue may be due to:

🚨 Potential Causes:
Unresolved Promises / No Cleanup on Error
If Axios calls fail and are not handled properly, unhandled rejections or lingering references might cause memory to grow.

Large Response Bodies or Error Objects
Axios may cache large responses or errors in memory, especially if you're storing them somewhere or not disposing of them.

Global Variables / Closures
Retaining references in scopes (like middleware or error handlers) can lead to memory not being released.

Event Listeners Not Removed
If you're attaching listeners in each request (e.g. to req, res, or Axios), they may pile up over time.

Axios Interceptors
If you’re using Axios interceptors and attaching new ones per request, they will accumulate and leak memory.

✅ Things to Check & Fix
1. Proper Error Handling with Axios
Make sure you always catch errors and avoid leaving rejected promises unresolved:

js
Copy
Edit
try {
  const response = await axios.get('http://spring-api...');
  res.json(response.data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Axios error:', error.message);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to fetch data' });
}
2. Avoid Re-adding Axios Interceptors on Every Request
js
Copy
Edit
// ❌ BAD: This will add a new interceptor on every request
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  axios.interceptors.request.use(...);
  next();
});
js
Copy
Edit
// ✅ GOOD: Add once during app initialization
axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  // Modify config
  return config;
});
3. Use a Dedicated Axios Instance
js
Copy
Edit
const axiosInstance = axios.create({ baseURL: 'http://spring-api' });

app.get('/proxy', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await axiosInstance.get('/endpoint');
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'API call failed' });
  }
});
This prevents global config pollution or leaks.

4. Memory Profiling Tips
You can use Node.js heap snapshots to analyze leaks:

Run with --inspect and use Chrome DevTools

Use heapdump or clinic.js:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save heapdump
In code:

js
Copy
Edit
const heapdump = require('heapdump');
heapdump.writeSnapshot('/path/to/snapshot.heapsnapshot');
5. Avoid Holding on to Error Objects
Avoid pushing errors into a global array or logging detailed error stacks to memory-heavy logs unless needed.

Summary
Ensure all Axios calls are try/catch-wrapped

Don't add interceptors per request

Avoid global variables holding request data

Use Axios instances

Profile with memory tools if the issue persists

If you'd like, you can share a code snippet of your route handler, and I’ll check it for any leaks or patterns that could cause memory issues.
